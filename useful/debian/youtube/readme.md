# Scripts

1. ytdlcli.sh - This script will ask what youtube video/playlist you want to download and then ask you if you want to convert it to mp3. [I ccidentally deleted the script in the confusion so I will redo it]
2. ytdlgui.sh - I have not started this script yet but it is going to be ytdlcli but it has a simple GUI
